"""
Today's challenge will be to do a word association game in python where the computer
finds words that begin with the same letter as the end of the previous word.

Example:
>> dog
>> goldfish
>> hippopotamus
>> snake
etc.

Recreate this game using the attached text file of pokemon names, and see what
the longest contiguous chain you can get. There can be no duplicate names!
